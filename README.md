# SEGMENT CSS


## Getting started
This was created with the Create React App so reference those docs whenever you can.

I kept the sass process on gulp since its up and running and I also use only the css output for Segment CSS.

## Running the App & output
This currently requires you to run to processes in your shell of choice.
```bash
yarn start:dev
```


This command gives you the final output, which is minified and only the css.
```bash
gulp prod
```
